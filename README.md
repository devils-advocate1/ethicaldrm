## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install SDK

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/devils-advocate1/ethicaldrm.git
cd [PROJECT_FOLDER_NAME]

# Create a Python virtual environment
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Create a .env file in the root directory and add your API key
# GOOGLE_API_KEY=AIzaSy...your_key_here...



#  Install the project in "editable mode" (this fixes all Python import paths)
pip install -e .

#  Install all required libraries
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application using the main entry script
python run.py

### 2. Embed Watermark in Video

```python
from ethicaldrm import Watermarker

wm = Watermarker(user_id="student_42")
wm.embed("lecture.mp4", "protected_lecture.mp4")
```

### 3. Detect Leaks from Telegram

```python
from ethicaldrm import LeakScanner

scanner = LeakScanner("protected_lecture.mp4")
scanner.scan_telegram_groups(["@piracychannel1", "@freecourseshub"])
```

### 4. Screen Recording Detection

```python
from ethicaldrm import ScreenRecorderDetector

detector = ScreenRecorderDetector()
detector.start_monitoring()
```

### 5. REST API Usage

```bash
# Start API server
ethicaldrm api --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000

# Embed watermark via API
curl -X POST -F "file=@video.mp4" -F "user_id=student_42" \
  http://localhost:5000/watermark/embed
```

## ⚙️ Modules

### 📼 video.watermark
- Adds invisible pixel-level watermark using LSB encoding or motion blur patterns
- Per-user dynamic watermarks
- Minimal visual impact

### 🖥️ recorder.detect
- Detects screen recorders (Windows/macOS/Linux)
- Alerts or disables playback temporarily
- Configurable response actions

### 🧠 leakbot
- Uses perceptual hashing (pHash) for content matching
- Crawls public forums, torrents, Telegram, and compares against original files
- Automated takedown notice generation

### 🌐 api
- Provides REST endpoints for all functionality
- File upload/download support
- Session management and reporting

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Run test suite
pytest tests/

# Run with coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=ethicaldrm --cov-report=html
```

Test coverage includes:
- Watermark accuracy and extraction
- Leak scan matching algorithms
- Screen recorder detection across platforms

## 📚 Example Use Cases

### 🔐 Case 1: Online Course Creator
```python
# Watermark each video with student ID
watermarker = Watermarker(user_id="student_123")
result = watermarker.embed("lesson1.mp4", "lesson1_protected.mp4")

# If leak is found, traceback is immediate
if result['success']:
    print(f"Student {result['user_id']} can be traced if content leaks")
```

### 🎥 Case 2: Indie Filmmaker
```python
# Set up automated leak monitoring
scanner = LeakScanner("my_film_trailer.mp4", similarity_threshold=0.9)
scanner.configure_platform('youtube', {
    'enabled': True,
    'keywords': ['my film title', 'indie film']
})

# Bot scans every 24 hours
scanner.start_scheduled_scanning()
```

## 💬 Ethical Philosophy

We believe security shouldn't punish the honest user. Our goals:

- ✅ **No harsh encryption** - Content remains accessible
- ✅ **No device lockouts** - Works on older devices  
- ✅ **Only trace + notify** when a leak happens
- ✅ **Transparency over surveillance** - Users know what's happening

📅 Future Roadmap (The Full Vision)

phase 1: Infrastructure & Bot Scaling
Expand to Telegram & Social Media: Evolve the Leakbot from a simple web scraper into a multi-platform monitor. I will build a dedicated module using Telethon to scan public and private Telegram channels and integrate with the YouTube API to find pirated content.

Distributed Architecture: Re-architect the bot into a distributed, event-driven microservice. This involves using a message queue (like RabbitMQ) to manage scan jobs for a pool of containerized Docker workers, enabling concurrent scanning of thousands of target sites simultaneously.

Phase 2: Advanced Forensic Detection
AI-Powered Perceptual Hashing: Move beyond simple file matching. I will train a custom Computer Vision model (like a Siamese Network). This will allow the bot to find leaked content even if it has been re-compressed, cropped, filtered, or screen-recorded from a phone.

Forensic Audio Watermarking: Expand the service to include spread-spectrum audio watermarking for podcasters and musicians, ensuring that even audio-only rips remain traceable.

Active Screen-Recorder Blocking: Build the planned C++/JavaScript module to proactively detect and block known screen-recording processes (like OBS and ShareX) at the client level, stopping leaks before they even happen.

Phase 3: Fully Automated Response & Analytics
Robo-DMCA (Full Automation): Evolve the "AI Report" into a fully automated takedown system. I will build direct API integrations with major cloud hosts (AWS, Cloudflare, Azure) and content platforms (YouTube, Vimeo) to auto-dispatch DMCA notices the instant a confirmed leak is detected, requiring zero human action.

Viral Leak Analysis (Graph DB): Implement a graph database (like Neo4j) to track the spread of a leak. When the bot finds a leak, it will also trace all outbound links on that page to map its viral spread across the internet, providing creators with a stunning visual dashboard of their content's exposure.

Full SaaS Platform: Launch the entire system as a tiered Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform, providing a central dashboard for creators to manage protected assets, view real-time leak analytics, and control their automated security responses.
